# pylivetrader-arm

Dockerfiles for [pylivetrader](github.com/alpacahq/pylivetrader) for arm based computers such as Raspberry Pi.

This version uses prebuilt wheels allowing for ease of use, building an image in under 20min. Therefore, the python version has been changed to 3.7 and Pipeline-Live is not inclued. If you are successful with installing Pipeline-Live with only using wheels, please submit a pull request on GitHub. Please refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for other library version changes.
